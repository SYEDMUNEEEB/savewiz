            The basis of the POPI Act is that organizations need to conduct
            themselves responsibly - responsible corporate citizenship.
            Organizations should not only be responsible but should be seen to be
            responsible corporate citizens. Part of this responsibility is to
            protect the information inside the organization, to be responsible
            when it comes to the process of storing and sharing personal
            information.

                with regard to the requester's personal information. We will not

                must comply with all the procedural requirements contained in
                PAIA relating to the request for access to a record. In
                considering such a request, we will adhere to the provisions of
                PAIA and the Information Officer will take all reasonable steps
                to inform a third party to whom the requested record relates of
                the request, informing the third party that he/she may make a
                written or oral representation to the Information Officer why the
                request should be refused or, where required, give written
                consent for the disclosure of the Information. We are not
                obliged to voluntarily grant access to such records. The
                requester must fulfill the prerequisite requirements as stated
                herein. The prescribed fees will be charged.
